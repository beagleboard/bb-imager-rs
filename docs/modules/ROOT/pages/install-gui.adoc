== Installation Instructions

=== Windows

. Download the Windows installer.
. Double-click the installer.
. Follow the on-screen instructions.

After installation, launch the application from the Start Menu.

==== Windows Security Notes

[IMPORTANT]
====
Flashing images requires low-level access to removable storage devices.

On Windows:

* You may be prompted by User Account Control (UAC) to allow elevated permissions.
* Some antivirus or endpoint security software may temporarily flag disk-writing tools.

These prompts are expected and required for the imaging process. Always ensure you downloaded the installer from an official BeagleBoard source.
====

=== macOS

. Open the downloaded application or disk image.
. Drag *BeagleBoard Imaging Utility* into the *Applications* folder.
. Launch it from *Applications* or Spotlight.

[NOTE]
====
macOS may ask for permission to access removable volumes the first time you run the application. Granting this access is required to write images to SD cards.
====

=== Linux (Flatpak – Recommended)

Flatpak provides a sandboxed installation and automatic updates via Flathub.

[source,shell]
----
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub org.beagleboard.imagingutility
----

To run the application:

[source,shell]
----
flatpak run org.beagleboard.imagingutility
----

==== Flatpak Permissions and Security Notes

[IMPORTANT]
====
Writing disk images requires access to removable storage devices.

When installed via Flatpak, the BeagleBoard Imaging Utility requests permissions to:

* Access removable drives
* Perform raw device writes

Your desktop environment may prompt you to approve these permissions the first time you run the application.  
These permissions are required to flash SD cards and USB storage devices and are limited to what the application needs to function.
====

=== Linux (AppImage)

AppImage is useful if you prefer a portable, self-contained executable.

[source,shell]
----
chmod +x bb-imager-*.AppImage
./bb-imager-*.AppImage
----

[NOTE]
====
On some Linux distributions, you may need to run the AppImage from a desktop session that allows access to removable media.
